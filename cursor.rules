Project: Color Analysis X

Project Description:
Color Analysis X is a web application that captures multiple pictures of the user from their webcam, provides helpful hints and lighting tips for accurate results, and uses AI-powered analysis to give users a comprehensive color analysis based on the 12-season color system.

Key Features:
1. Webcam integration for capturing 5 pictures per session
2. Real-time hints and lighting tips for optimal photo quality
3. AI-powered color analysis using OpenAI API through LangChain
4. Comprehensive color analysis results based on the 12-season color system
5. Sleek, modern, and easy-to-use UI with 4 main components

Technical Stack:

Frontend:
- Framework: React 17.0.2 with TypeScript
- State Management: React Hooks (useState)
- API Communication: Axios
- UI Components: Custom React components
- Webcam Integration: react-webcam

Backend:
- Language: Python 3.9
- Framework: Flask
- CORS handling: flask-cors
- AI Integration: LangChain with OpenAI

API Integration:
- OpenAI API through LangChain for multimodal data processing

Containerization:
- Docker and Docker Compose

Infrastructure:
- Local development environment
- Potential for future deployment on Linode (not implemented yet)

CI/CD:
- Not implemented yet, but considered for future

Key Components:
1. WebcamCapture: Handles image capture from the webcam
2. AnalysisResults: Displays the color analysis results
3. TipsGuide: Provides tips for optimal photo capture
4. ProgressIndicator: Shows the current step in the analysis process

Workflow:
1. User captures 5 images using the webcam
2. Images are sent to the backend for analysis
3. Backend processes images using OpenAI API via LangChain
4. Results are returned to the frontend and displayed to the user

Development Workflow:
- Use of Makefile for common development tasks
- Docker Compose for running the application in containers

Environment Variables:
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Required for backend to communicate with OpenAI API


Ports:
- Frontend: 3034 (host) -> 3000 (container)
- Backend: 8034 (host) -> 5000 (container)

Next Steps:
1. Implement error handling and user feedback
2. Enhance UI/UX design
3. Add unit and integration tests
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline
5. Prepare for production deployment
